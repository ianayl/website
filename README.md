My website, generated using shsg

... or at least that's the plan

Static site generators are cool, but they're also kind of heavily contrived for what they are. So I thought hey, why not write my own simple "static site generator"... if you can even call shsg that... for my site? This idea was ~~totally not stolen from~~ inspired by https://github.com/kisslinux/website. 

~~I wish Dylan Araps was my dad.~~
