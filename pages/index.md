# My name is Ian Li, Welcome to My Site.

I am an incoming computer science freshman at the University of Toronto. I love anything computer related, and I am particularly interested in programming languages, operating systems, and learning new things.
Check out [about](about.html) for my contact information, as well as what I have to offer. If you're interested, you can also check out my [blog](blog/index.html) for random things I put in there that I am interested in.
